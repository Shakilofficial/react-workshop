- Creating reusable UI components

**Interview Question:**
- **Q: What is React?**
  - **A:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of applications efficiently.

### Components
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be either class-based or functional, and they encapsulate the UI and behavior of a part of the application.

**Example:**
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Reusable UI elements
- Encapsulation of functionality

**Interview Question:**
- **Q: What are React components?**
  - **A:** React components are independent, reusable pieces of UI that can be nested, managed, and handled separately.

### JSX
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It is used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

**Example:**
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

**Use Cases:**

  - **A:** Props are inputs to a React component that allow data to be passed from parent to child components. They are read-only and help configure components.

### State
State is a built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component. When the state changes, the component re-renders.

**Example:**
```jsx
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { date: new Date() };
  }
}
```

**Use Cases:**

# React Hooks:
Let's go through each of these React hooks, explaining their purpose, providing examples, and discussing real-life use cases.

### 1. `useState`
**Purpose:** Manages state in functional components.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Use Case:** Managing a counter value that increments each time a button is clicked.

### 2. `useEffect`
**Purpose:** Manages side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</div>;
}
```

**Use Case:** Fetching data from an API when the component mounts.

### 3. `useContext`
**Purpose:** Accesses context values without using a Consumer component.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>I am styled by theme context!</button>;
}
```

**Use Case:** Accessing a theme value from a context to style components.

### 4. `useRef`
**Purpose:** Accesses or manipulates DOM elements directly and persists values across renders without causing re-renders.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
  const inputEl = useRef(null);

  const onButtonClick = () => {
    inputEl.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Use Case:** Focusing an input element programmatically.

### 5. `useMemo`
**Purpose:** Memoizes values to optimize performance by avoiding expensive calculations on every render.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

function ExpensiveCalculationComponent({ a, b }) {
  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
    return a * b; // Assume this is an expensive calculation
  }, [a, b]);

  return <div>The result is {expensiveValue}</div>;
}
```

function ParentComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }, []);

  return <ChildComponent onClick={increment} />;
}

function ChildComponent({ onClick }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Increment</button>;
}
```

**Use Case:** Passing a stable function reference to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### 7. `useReducer`
**Purpose:** Manages complex state logic, similar to `useState` but with a reducer function.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Use Case:** Managing state transitions in a counter application with multiple actions.

### 8. `useLayoutEffect`
**Purpose:** Similar to `useEffect`, but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. Useful for reading layout from the DOM and synchronously re-rendering.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useLayoutEffect, useRef } from 'react';

function LayoutEffectExample() {
  const ref = useRef();

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    console.log(ref.current.getBoundingClientRect());
  }, []);

  return <div ref={ref}>Hello, world!</div>;
}
```

**Use Case:** Measuring DOM elements before the browser has a chance to paint.

### 9. `useImperativeHandle`
**Purpose:** Customizes the instance value that is exposed when using `ref` with `React.forwardRef`.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useImperativeHandle, useRef, forwardRef } from 'react';

const FancyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus: () => {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  }));

  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
});

function Parent() {
  const ref = useRef();

  return (
    <>
      <FancyInput ref={ref} />
      <button onClick={() => ref.current.focus()}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Use Case:** Exposing imperative methods from a child component to a parent component.

### 10. `useId`
**Purpose:** Generates unique IDs for accessibility attributes like `aria-*` and `id`. Available in React 18+.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useId } from 'react';

function Form() {
  const id = useId();

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor={id}>Name:</label>
      <input id={id} type="text" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Use Case:** Generating unique IDs for form elements to ensure accessibility.
